In this module, we are considering sentencing patterns, and possible bias, in criminal cases adjudicated in Federal District Courts, 2006--2020.  The cases heard in these 94 courts, which are organized into 11 districts, are restricted to those that involve federal statutes, interpretations of the US Constitution, or cases that concern more than one state.  In criminal cases resulting in a conviction, the crime statute itself may have sentencing restrictions, but beyond that judge has literally complete freedom in setting the length of the prison term.  Along with looking at this data overall, we will focus on the question of possible bias within individual districts.

In 1987, the United States Sentencing Commission created sentencing guidelines for Federal Courts.  These guidelines prescribe a range of possible prison terms, taking into account both the severity of the crime and the prior criminal history of the defendant, as well as numerous possible mitigating factors (ones that may call for shortening the sentence) and aggravating factors (ones that may call for lengthening the sentence).  Although these guidelines were initially mandatory, in 2005 a Supreme Court ruling changed them to being only advisory, returning great freedom in sentencing to each individual judge.

We will analyze the over one-half million sentencing records spanning the years 2006 to 2020 provided by the US Sentencing Commission.  Publicly available data is usually quite messy, with many missing and ambiguous entries.  For this reason, you will be using a curated copy, that is, one that has been "cleaned up."  (Directions for obtaining the curated copy is in the following section of this module.)  The sentence lengths we are using are given in months and do not include probation nor alternative confinement. Since our aim is to compare lengths of prison sentences imposed, we have eliminated from the data set any cases involving non-citizens, those sentences frequently involve deportation, which is not comparable to prison terms.  We combined the information from some variables (creating new variables) and eliminated incomplete data items, that is entire records, for defendants for whom we are not given sufficient information.  We have eliminated the (relatively few) records with sentence lengths of more than 470 months, but retained those with life sentences, which have been coded by the Commission as 470 months.  Finally, because there are very few defendants sentenced in the district court of the Northern Mariana Islands, those items were also eliminated.

The data come from two sources: the pre-sentencing report and the Statement of Reasons.  The pre-sentencing report is prepared by the District's Probation Office and based on a post-trial, pre-sentencing investigation including an interview with the defendant.  A draft of this report is issued to the attorneys for comments and corrections and a final version is given to the attorneys and judge.  The Statement of Reasons is a form filled out by the judge explaining/supporting the sentence imposed.

The two main variables used in the non-mandatory guidelines for sentencing are criminal_history and all_adjustments, the second of which indicates the severity of the crime.  The two are combined, using a table, to determine the recommended range of the sentence.

The variable criminal_history is coded as a value 1--6, with 1 including a defendant with at most one conviction, where that conviction resulted in a sentence of less than 60 days.  Prior convictions are assigned "points," depending on the number of prior convictions, length(s) of sentence(s), and whether or not past crimes involved violence.  The points are then summed and translated into a "criminal history category," represented by the criminal_history values 1 through 6.  As additional example, a defendant has  three prior convictions with sentences of over 13 months and two with sentences between 2 and 13 months would be assigned a total of 13 points, yielding the criminal history category 6.  With only one prior conviction of each type, the category would be 3.  The calculation is not quite this simple, with many adjustments and some types of convictions and very old convictions being ignored.

The variable all_adjustments is a rating of the offense level (how severe the crime is) with adjustments (added considerations that call for higher or lower offense level), as defined by the US Sentencing Commission's Sentencing Guidelines Manual and interpreted by the US Probation Office and/or the Presiding Judge.  There are 43 levels with, for example, first degree murder having a base level (that is, level prior to adjustments) of 43 and trespass having a base level of 4.
